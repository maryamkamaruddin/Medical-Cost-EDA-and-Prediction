- About this project : Personal Project
- Tools : Python (Kaggle Notebook : https://www.kaggle.com/code/maryamaddin/medical-cost-eda-and-prediction)

About Dataset
- This dataset provides medical cost information for individuals based on various personal attributes. The aim of this notebook is to perform an exploratory data analysis (EDA) and understand the factors that influence medical charges.

Attributes
- ID: A unique identifier assigned to each individual record.
- Age: The age of the individual.
- Sex: Gender of the individual.
- BMI: Body Mass Index of the individual, indicating the level of obesity.
- Children: Number of children of the individual.
- Smoker: Smoking status.
- Region: Residential area in the US.
- Medical Cost: Annual medical costs incurred by the individual.

Objectives of the Analysis
- Identify potential outliers and their influence on cost.
- Understand the distribution of the features.
- Explore relationships between medical charges and other features.
- Check for correlations between medical charges and other features.
- Create a logistic regression model to classify individuals into high-cost vs low-cost, based on the features.
- Build a linear regression model to predict insurance chargers based on other features.
- Provide actionable insights for healthcare analysts.
